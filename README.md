studying transfers to mars launching in 2022 with the hopse of minimising energy and time used.

First need to generate a 3 body model of the solar system, will be using the Runge-kutta 4 method (RK4) to model the interactions between the objects in the solar system. That 3 body system will need a gravity function to work.
